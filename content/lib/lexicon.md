# Lexicon v2.1.6

Lexicon is a localization system focused around on simplifying implementation of adding translation to your GameMaker Studio 2.3+ project, all the while allowing specific sections to be replaced on the fly!
It supports the following:

* Substring Replacement/s. (Replacing `%s` with `Hello World!`)
* Substring Replacement/s via struct variables 
* Adding/removing languages through built-in functionality.
* Supports CSV/JSON parsing. (As well as functions to help easily add more parsers)
