# Particore

Simplified particle type generation for GameMakerStudio and GameMakerStudio 2

## Usage

To use Particore, download [the latest release](https://github.com/gm-core/particore/releases), and import the .yymps package into your project. For detailed instructions, follow [this guide](https://gmcore.io/installing.html).

## What Particore Does

Particore is largely a convenience wrapper around the `part_type` functions. The `part_type` functions require you to always provide the particle ID you want to customize, and require a lot of arguments, which can often be useless. Particore wraps these functions to provide a quick control flow as well as reasonable defaults for most of these values, so that you only specify what you need to.

Example:

```gml
// Create a new particle and mark it as the active particle type
partType = pt_new();

// Set some properties on this particle type!
pt_color(c_red);
pt_speed(2, 5);
pt_sprite(spr_particle);
pt_direction(PT.Any);
pt_orientation(PT.Relative);
pt_life(60, 120);
```

### Defaulting

Since Particore allows you to omit most arguments, it uses a defaulting strategy that is as follows:

1. For `min` and `max` values, omitting the max sets it to the min value.
2. For boolean values, the default is false.
3. For numeric values (besides min/max), the default is 0. (Few exceptions)
4. For particle functions with a `2` and `3` version (`color` and `alpha`), argument count determines which function is used.

## API

### `pt_new()`

Creates a new particle type and sets it as the current working particle.

### `pt_with(partType)`

Sets the given part type as the current working particle.

```gml
var part = part_type_create();
pt_with(part);
pt_color(c_red);
```

### `pt_shape(shape)`

Shorthand for `part_type_shape`. Sets the shape of the current working particle to one of the built-in particle shapes.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_shape(pt_shape_cloud);
```

### `pt_blend(additive)`

Shorthand for `part_type_blend`. It takes a boolean, `true` for additive blending, `false` for normal.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_blend(true);
```

### `pt_sprite(sprite, optionalAnimate, optionalStretch, optionalRandom)`

Shorthand for `part_type_sprite`. Only the first argument is required.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_sprite(spr_particle);
```

### `pt_size(minSize, optionalMaxSize, optionalIncr, optionalWiggle)`

Shorthand for `pt_type_size`. Only the first argument is required.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_size(.75, 1.25);
```

### `pt_speed(minSpeed, optionalMaxSpeed, optionalIncr, optionalWiggle)`

Shorthand for `part_type_speed`. Only the first argument is required.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_speed(2, 4);
```

### `pt_direction(minDir, optionalMaxDir, optionalIncr, optionalWiggle)`

Shorthand for `part_type_direction`. Only the first argument is required.

You can also pass in only `PT.Any` for a default set of `0, 364, 0, 0` if you want to make a particle that just goes any direction.

```gml
var straightPart = pt_new();
pt_direction(90);

var allDirPart = pt_new();
pt_direction(PT.Any);
```

### `pt_orientation(minDir, optionalMaxDir, optionalIncr, optionalWiggle)`

Shorthand for `part_type_orientation`. Only the first argument is required.

You can pass in `PT.Any` here for a default set of `0, 364, 0, 0`.

You can also pass in `PT.Relative` to enable relative orientation to the direction.

```gml
var downPart = pt_new();
pt_orientation(270);

var anyPart = nt_new();
pt_orientation(PT.Any);

var relativePart = pt_new();
pt_orientation(PT.Relative);
```

### `pt_life(minLife, optionalMaxLife)`

Shorthand for `part_type_life`. Only the first argument is required. Omitting a max lifespan sets the max and min to be the same.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_life(60, 120);
```

### `pt_step(stepPart, optionalStepCount)`

Shorthand for `part_type_step`. Only the first argument is required.

`optionalStepCount` defaults to `1`.

```gml
var stepPart = pt_new();

var part = pt_new();
pt_step(stepPart);
```

### `pt_death(deathPart, optionalDeathCount)`

Shorthand for `part_type_death`. Only the first argument is required.

`optionalDeathCount` defaults to `1`.

```gml
var deathPart = pt_new();

var part = pt_new();
pt_death(deathPart);
```

### `pt_color(color, optionalColor2, optionalColor3)`

Shorthand for `part_type_color`, `part_type_color2`, and `part_type_color3` depending on how many arguments have been provided.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_color(c_red, c_yellow);
```

### `pt_alpha(alpha, alpha2, alpha3)`

Shorthand for `part_type_alpha`, `part_type_alpha2`, and `part_type_alpha3` depending on how many arguments have been provided.

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_alpha(1, 0);
```

### `pt_free(partType)`

Shorthand for `part_type_destroy`

```gml
var part = pt_new();
pt_free(part);
```
