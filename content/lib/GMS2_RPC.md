# About
**GMS2_RPC** is a Discord Rich Presence Module for GameMaker Studio 2 IDE.     
It is a small application that is to run in background and supply your Discord profile with Rich Presence containing information specific to GameMaker Studio 2 IDE while it is running, as exemplified below.

The application is standalone and does not interact with any part of GameMaker Studio 2 itself. It gathers all of its information from the process list and window title of GameMaker Studio 2 IDE.


# Features

* Uses Discord Rich Presence to display project name that is currently being open in GameMaker Studio 2 IDE, as well as the current session time.
* Supports multiple instances of the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE running at the same time and focuses on ones that have a project open.
* Shows if you are currently running an application via the runner of GameMaker Studio 2 IDE (when there is only one project open in total).
* Supports Beta builds of the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE.

* Configurable via right-click context menu of its tray icon. It can setup autostart on system boot (using current user's registry to application's current location), toggle display of project titles and permamently hide the tray icon.
* Left-clicking the tray icon will create a notification that displays the total uptime of GameMaker Studio 2 IDE while this application was running.
