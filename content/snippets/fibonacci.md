=========

Returns the nth number of the [Fibonacci sequence].

_Wikipedia:_
> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted \(F_n\)â€Š,
> form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number
> is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly
> starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial
> terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2.
> Starting from 0 and 1, the next few values in the sequence are:
>
> \(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\)
